title: End-to-end Differentiable Simulations

description: |
      We will create and end-to-end simulation framework that ties together electronic, atomic scale, morphological, and device scale properties using Density Functional Theory (DFT), Molecular Dynamics (MD), Phase Field, and Battery Models.
